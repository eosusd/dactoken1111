# Token/Member Contract

This contract creates the currency and also give a means to say whether an eosDAC account holder is a member.  A member is classified as a token holder who has registered and agreed to the membership agreement.

Once this contract is launched we will issue a quantity of eosDAC tokens equivalent to the number of issued ERC-20 tokens minus the number never collected.
